## Warning

The app idea inspired by two blog posts: [How Sketch took over 200GB of our MacBooks](https://medium.com/@thomasdegry/how-sketch-took-over-200gb-of-our-macbooks-cb7dd10c8163) & [How to recover 50 GB or even more by deleting Sketch caches files](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/how-to-recover-50-go-or-even-more-by-deleting-sketch-caches-files-e5829dba20e1)

Please, read them in case you want to know how it works.

If your **workflow** relies on **automatic versioning** by macOS
(Time Machine etc.) - **DO NOT USE THIS APP!**

The app will remove all files in folder: /.DocumentRevisions-V100/
